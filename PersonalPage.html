		People are going to wonder why you’re trying to be different; it’s just a natural instinct. If I was to walk down the street in a kilt, then <br/>dudes would wonder why I’m doing that, they’d think I was different or gay. It’s natural for people to point fingers. That’s my whole reason for<br/> trying to switch things up; don’t judge a book by it’s cover.” – Kid Cudi <br/>

			To me sports are more than just a simple game, its one of the only things that truely make me happy in the world.I have always love sports,<br/> 
			i have been playing "ball" in my mother vomb for 5 of the nine months i was in there so i have been a sports lover from before birth.<br/> 
			I am the type of person to watch or play any type of sport , you name it.However there are three that stands out amoung the rest for me.<br/> 
			<ol>  
				<li>basket ball</li> 
				<p>
				<img src = "../Assets/basketball.jpg" height = "300" width "200px" /><br/><br/>
			Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.<br/>

										<h4> Reflection </h4>
											I took two online personality test.
											I believe that both the test are valid becasue they are some very camptivating and deep questions on there websites.
											The results that i aquired from both test are both valid because the reports that i recieved definely encapsulates me as a individual.
