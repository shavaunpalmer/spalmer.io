		<h1>Strengths</h1>
			<ul type="square">  
			<li>Collaboration skills</li>  
				<p>
					I enjoy working in teams and am a very collaborative person. Members of the project teams I've led interact with a diversity of people and are inspired by a wide range of creative challenges. Over the course of three years since I started leading my current team, I've raised productivity by 15% and retention by 25%.<br/>
				</p>
			<li>Persistence</li>
				<p>
					I'm meticulous and persistent. I keep track of the particulars when working on a project. I can identify the fundamentals and tenaciously push for them to achieve deadlines since I have a thorough understanding of the components. This is something that my peers' and management's feedback frequently reflects.<br/>
				</p>
				
			<li>leadership skills</li>  
				<p>
					I've always had a natural ability to lead. I have more than three years of expertise in information technolgy, and for the past 2 years, I have twice been promoted . When I reflect on those accomplishments, I am aware that without the teams and other employees I developed and the leadership I provided for them, I would not have been able to achieve these skills that i have.<br/>
				</p>
			<li>Solving problems</li>  
				<P>
					I am a quick learner who is focused on finding answers. When designing equipment in my capacity as an computer technician, I had to work well under pressure because our team couldn't secure a contract unless we swiftly and efficiently delivered the tools to fix any computer whenever. In these situations, I am not hesitant to seek clarification by asking questions. For every customer, I conduct in-depth study so that I can be better prepared.<br/>

		<h2> Reflections </h2>
		<p>
			In the past five years i have totally chnaged my outlock on life. I went from a carless procastinator in high school to a well rounded individual that adds a great value to any situation that i am placed in.I never use to like to collaborate with other that much , but i have developed myself by listening more to others, now i love to collaborate with my family, friends and coworkes.
		</p>
			<p>
				I was not always the most persistent person out there so i had to be determaine. I grew to be very persistent from the influence of my mother.She showed me that through persistence and God grace and glory Nothing is imposible if you continuously work hard.So for the past five years i can confidentl say that i ahve been the most persistent i have ever been , and everyday i keep on working on my persistency. 
			</P>
			
				<p>
					From as far as basic school i can remember me being a leader, So being a leader always came natural to me.But even though i have any been a natural leader there were still some aspects that was lacking in my attemps to lead. I was not a leader that listened to others advise in the begining.But over time i acquired the knowledge and strength to be a true leader by listening more to others oppinion and analizing there thoughts and turning them into contructive things. 
				</p>
				
					<p>
						Problems are always going to be things that we as individual will have to deal with. No one like problems, we all wish that we could go through life without problems but sadly life is not that way.Like anyone else i have had mt fair share of problems to deal with.So i was noy successful in solving throughout the years but i have developed attributes that promote my problems solving skills. In the past Five years i have had so much to deal with but with the skills that i have acquired Solve most problems with ease.

							<h2 > Summary and Reflection for chapter 4 </h2>
							
								In chapter 4, it illustrates a man named Michael is going through some sort more mid life crisis.michael is a middle ages man with a stable job and family , however that is not the futer middle say for him self.Michael as a lot of goals and aspirations that he invision for him self.He feels traped in his current job but is too scared to do anything about it. Charlie who is michael old time friend who he met at the Twelve Pillars.By asking michael so questions charlie quickly realised that michael as a lot of aspirations but for some reason michael is stuck in a mediocre and dull life.michael told charlie about this situation and charlie who seems to be a wiser and older gentle man gave him tips,scenarios,advise,examples and so one and how michael can start achieving is goals.  
						</p>
							<p>
								while reading chapter 4 I actually started to reflect on my current life situation and I realised that I am current ina  similar situation as michael although I have a good job and some what of a good family i am still feeling the same way in with michael stated.However I am pretty younger than michael i assume, so i believe that within the next couple of years all my goals will be accessed and achieved with the help of god.

						<h2> Summary and Reflection for chapter 5 </h2>
							In chapter 4,illustrate that michael does not adequately uses the time that god as blessed him with.He states that he is bombarded with work and is family so it will be difficult to change his trajectory in the right direction of goal achieving.Mr.Davis’s is a man that charlie regularly quotes when talking to michael stated that "We must all suffer from one of two pains: The pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons." Throughout the rest of this chapter charlie uses several more quotes from Mr.Davis’s to bring across is point that michael should state properly using is time or do less in some areas of is life to proport the areas and things that will enable michael to starte achieving those goals before it is definely too late for him.
							
					</p>
					
						<p>
							We all tend to misuse our time so more than other.I personally am guilty of this . So times I tend to put of certain decision for in the future because am either busy with work or my family. For example I could have been in my final year of university right now if I did not take a too years break from school. The break was not really that time wasting, because I was working and acquiring so more to futher my study. But I still could have used student loan in stead of wasting those years that I will never get back. Because I was actually granted the student loan but as michael I was properly using my time . Now I believe that my time is being used in the most genuine way possible .

							<h2 > Summary and Reflection for chapter 6 </h2>
								After michael and charlie pervious meeting , michael took alot from that meeting and started to actually apply what was said in is day to day life. He actually wrote down the 100 goals that charlie told him to do in the pervious meeting at marks diner.Michael as been feeling very motivated and driven.The goals he wrote was starting to positively weigh on michaels mind, which can make those dreams become a reality. Michael was very happy about their last meeting and was eager to hear more from charlie, and charlie was excited to share with michael.Charlie asked michael who he was spending is time around and told him that those people have tremendous influence on his destiny. He started to think about his three best friends who he spends most his friday evenings. Michael started to tell charlie all about is three best friends. Charlie quickly realised that michael needed to make some adjustments in his friendships. Charlie then explained to michael why he probaly need to surround is self with different people . Michael was was stunnded after all those were is best friends he as know for years. Michael realised that his friends were convenient because he knew them for decades , so it would be easier to stay friends with them instead of pursuing other friends that could positively impact his life . Michael never wanted to leave any of his friends behind but from all that charlie was saying he knew that it was the right thing to do.
								
							</p>
								<p>
									while reading chapter 6 I realised that its definely ok to let some people so out of our lifes. I have some friends right now that are like michaels friends , I know those friends from as far as I can remember and they are like family to me.I would not say they are bad people but they are mostly unemployed and most days when I am coming in from work they are on a corner begging me to buy them a splif.Normally it is not a problem for me to buy them it , afterall they have been my friends forever. However after reading Chapter 6 i realised that my friends are actually having a negative influence on my life the same way that michaels friends are, and that I should actually leave these friendships behind and try to develope friendships with people that share my values and interest.

								<h2 > Summary and Reflection for chapter 7 </h2>
									In this chapter charlie told michael that he should be a life long learner.He continued by sharing the difference between formal and self education.Charlie said that self education is what you teach your self over the years .He tells michael that although formal education is important , that self education is the key to a sucessful life.He continued by tell him a few mainstays to learning that anyone can use to improve their live.One of those mainstays is to read books regularly. However michael have not read a book in quite a while. Charlie expresses the importance of reading books and that all the successful people that the aspires to be like are well read. Charlie told mark that not reading a book in so long may be a catalyst to his problems and that he needs to read at least one more book before their next visit else there won't be another meeting. Charlie gave michael a list of ten books that he recommend him to read. Before michael left the meeting charlie gave him a book he have finished and michael was very grateful.
								
								</P>
								
								<p>
									In this chapter it was very captivating because I never really compared formal and self learning before but after reading this chapter I realise which is more important and which one I should spend time on mastering more.The rest of the chapter shows me that reading books are very important .I personally do not read books myself like michael and my that could be a cause for my problems.Now that I am more exposed to the importance of reading I will try to at least read one book every three months to try and brighten my horizons.
